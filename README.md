# Turbulent-Duct-Flow-Multi-Reynolds-CFD
This project performs comprehensive CFD analysis of turbulent flow within a rectangular duct using various Reynolds numbers. The study aims to investigate flow characteristics, validate turbulence models, and analyze the effects of Reynolds number variation on flow behavior using Computational Fluid Dynamics methodologies.
