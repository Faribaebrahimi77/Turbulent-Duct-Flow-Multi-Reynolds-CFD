# Turbulent-Duct-Flow-Multi-Reynolds-CFD
This project performs comprehensive CFD analysis of turbulent flow within a rectangular duct using various Reynolds numbers. The study aims to investigate flow characteristics, validate turbulence models, and analyze the effects of Reynolds number variation on flow behavior using Computational Fluid Dynamics methodologies.

Near the wall, viscous stresses dominate over Reynolds stresses because the random velocity fluctuations are reduced in this region. This area is referred to as the inner layer. Moving away from the wall, the amplitude of turbulent fluctuations increases and Reynolds stresses become dominant; this region is called the outer layer. Between these two regions, there is an overlap layer, where both stresses are of comparable magnitude. Understanding these layers and the fluid behavior in each region is one of the most important aspects of flow analysis.
